    <p>Hidden deep within the nuclei of a tiny fraction of giant galaxies, supermassive black holes spew out enormous jets of relativistic plasmas. But which few of all the otherwise normal-looking galaxies are undergoing this monstrous surge of activity? This is the mission of Radio Galaxy Zoo &ndash; to find those galaxies &ndash; and enable radio, optical, and X-ray astronomers to study them in more detail, and determine how these monsters erupt.
