          <p class="description">Black holes are found at the center of most, if not all, galaxies. The bigger the galaxy, the bigger the black hole and the more sensational the effect it has on the host galaxy. These supermassive black holes drag in nearby materials, growing to be billions of times the size of our sun and occasionally producing spectacular jets of materials travelling nearly as fast as the speed of light. Often invisible in visible light, but detectable in radio wavelengths, astronomers need help to find these jets and match them to the galaxy that hosts them.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Why do astronomers need your help?</h1>
        <p class="description">Black holes cannot be observed, light cannot escape from them, but we can detect them by observing the effect they have on their surroundings.  There are a number of methods for detecting these effects, but the supermassive black holes found at the center of galaxies cannot be observed in the optical or infrared due to the large amounts of dust obscuring absorbing the light in those wavelengths. Fortunately the jets of materials spewed out by these supermassive black holes can be observed in the radio wavelengths.</p>

        <p class="description">There is a great deal of valuable information that can be obtained from the radio images of these jets, but we need to understand the host galaxy too. For instance observing the host galaxy in the optical allows us to determine its distance, which is critical to understanding how big and how luminous the black hole actually is.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">What do astronomers hope to learn?</h1>
        <p class="description">  Astronomers have a good understanding of how small black holes, that are a couple of times the size of the Sun, form. The picture is less clear for the supermassive black holes found in the center of galaxies. In order to better understand how these black holes form and evolve over time, astronomers need to observe many of them at different stages of their lifecycles. To do this, they need to find them first!</p>
          <p class="description">In addition, it is possible that the jets from the supermassive black hole somehow heat up and disrupt the gas within its host galaxy, regulating the star formation rate, or even increasing it. Once again astronomers can only begin to understand the relationship between a host galaxyâ€™s star formation rate and their supermassive black holes if they can observe many of them. <a href="#/science">More ...</a></p>
